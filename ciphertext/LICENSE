10. Limitation on Liability
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE SHALL CRYPTOLAB BE LIABLE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, AND OTHERWISE, FOR ANY (a) INCREASED COSTS, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR LOST BUSINESS, PRODUCTION, REVENUES OR PROFITS, (b) LOSS OF GOODWILL OR REPUTATION, (c) USE, INABILITY TO USE, LOSS, INTERRUPTION, DELAY OR RECOVERY OF ANY LICENSED SOFTWARE OR OPEN SOURCE COMPONENTS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS, (d) LOSS, DAMAGE, CORRUPTION, OR RECOVERY OF DATA, OR BREACH OF DATA OR SYSTEM SECURITY, (e) COST OF REPLACEMENT GOODS OR SERVICES, OR (f) CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, ENHANCED, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, IN EACH CASE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PERSONS WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES OR SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE OTHERWISE FORESEEABLE, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY AGREED OR OTHER REMEDY OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

Your payment of the Liquidated Damages is your sole liability and entire obligation and CryptoLab's exclusive remedy for any Licensee Breach.
12. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution; Remedies
You agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including any questions regarding its breach, existence, validity or termination (the “Dispute”), shall be resolved amicably. You agree that either party may commence such a process by requesting a meeting with the other party, which may take place in person, or remotely. You agree that if the Dispute is not resolved within five (5) business days of the meeting between the parties, then:
(a) The Dispute may, at either party's request, be referred to mediation in accordance with the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board (“KCAB”),  and informal negotiations need not continue. Either party may initiate the mediation process by giving notice in writing, requesting mediation, to the other party (the “Mediation Notice”).
(b) If there is any aspect of the form or conduct of the mediation (including the identity of the mediator to be appointed) on which the parties cannot agree within three (3) business days from the date of delivery of the Mediation Notice, KCAB shall, at the request of either party, decide that point, having first made reasonable efforts to consult with each of the parties on the issue.
(c) The mediation shall start not later than seven (7) business days from the date of delivery of the Mediation Notice.
(d) The mediation shall take place in the Republic of Korea and the language of the mediation shall be English.
(e) The KCAB International Mediation Rules shall be governed by the substantive law of the Republic of Korea.
(f) KCAB's fees, and those of the mediator together with other expenses of the mediation, will be borne equally by the parties.
(g) Each party will bear its own costs and expenses of its participation in the mediation.
You agree and acknowledge that a request by CryptoLab to a court of competent jurisdiction for interim measures to preserve CryptoLab’s rights, including but not limited to a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, shall not be construed as incompatible with, or a waiver of, this agreement to mediate a Dispute.
13. Export Regulation
You agree to perform this Agreement in compliance with export control and international economic sanctions laws or regulations that apply to you.
14. Waiver
No waiver by CryptoLab of any term or condition set out in this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of CryptoLab to assert a right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
15. Severability
If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.
16. Entire Agreement
This Agreement contains the entire agreement between you and CryptoLab with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Software.
